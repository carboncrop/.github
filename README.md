## 🌍 About CarbonCrop

CarbonCrop exists to **“Keep Carbon Simple”** through an AI-powered forest restoration platform. We help landholders, catchment groups, and businesses to:

- **🧮 Measure**, **monitor**, and **monetise** carbon removals using high-resolution imagery and AI models:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Forecast sequestration**, track forest gains and losses, and report progress with accuracy:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Support native forestry**, ecosystem resilience, and biodiversity, particularly in New Zealand:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

Founded in 2020 as a spin‑off from the Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute, our platform has assessed over 4 million ha of land, facilitated registration of 1,000+ ha of native forest, and helped remove over 350,000 t of CO₂ to date:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
