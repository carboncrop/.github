## 🌍 About CarbonCrop

CarbonCrop exists to **“Keep Carbon Simple”** through an AI-powered forest restoration platform. We help landholders, catchment groups, and businesses to:

- **🧮 Measure**, **monitor**, and **monetise** carbon removals using high-resolution imagery and AI models
- **Forecast sequestration**, track forest gains and losses, and report progress with accuracy
- **Support native forestry**, ecosystem resilience, and biodiversity, particularly in New Zealand

Founded in 2020 as a spin‑off from the Nelson Artificial Intelligence Institute, our platform has assessed over 4 million ha of land, facilitated registration of 1,000+ ha of native forest, and helped remove over 350,000 t of CO₂ to date.

## Where's our code?

Our code is all in private repositories, so you probably won't see anything here. For more info about us, go to carboncrop.com.
